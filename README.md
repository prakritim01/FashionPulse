## 🧠 Project Reflection: AI Architecture
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Science pipeline bridging the gap between high-performance sports and luxury fashion.

### The Tech Stack:
* **Data Ingestion:** Used `FastF1` to pull real-time race telemetry and session results from the 2025 F1 Season.
* **Sentiment AI:** Implemented a `HuggingFace Transformers` pipeline (DistilBERT) to analyze luxury fashion discourse.
* **Custom Classification:** Developed an **Aesthetic Vector Mapper** to categorize social sentiment into niches like *Old Money*, *Quiet Luxury*, and *Racing Chic*.
* **Automation (CI/CD):** Engineered a `GitHub Actions` workflow to automatically update the pulse analysis every Monday after a Grand Prix.

### Strategic Goal:
To provide a quantitative "Influence Score" that helps luxury brands measure their ROI in Formula 1 sponsorships.
